turtlify
========

Everyone needs a turtle.

Turtlify is a kind reminder to poeple who forget to log off when fetching coffee. Just give them a turtle in their shell. Why? Because there is a poor turtle without a shell and it needs a new home!

To marry your turtle with the your (zsh, bash,...) shell, run the following command:

```wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tburny/turtlify/master/turtlify.sh && chmod +x turtlify.sh && turtlify.sh | bash```

This will download the turtlify script, make it executable and execute it afterwards.
You can see the source code anytime (and should check it) before you do that.

### I received a turtle
If you want to remove a turtle someone gave your shell, just remove the according ```echo``` command at the end of ```~/.bashrc``` and/or ```~/.zshrc``` with your favourite ```$EDITOR```.
